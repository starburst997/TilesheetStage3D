TilesheetStage3D
================

This fork use premultiplied alpha to fix dark border on PNG, also use the AGSLS Assembler instead of the compiled binary (only for the asmooth shader for the moment)

Also compatible with OpenFL 2.1.2

This is a class which extends openfl.display.Tilesheet and adds stage3D support to the drawTiles method, if available.

Currently it's not very fast at rendering lots of sprites, but at least, it's much better than default Flash fallback(In tilelayer).
Also it has much lower CPU consumption.

### How to use it
    //Init Stage3D
    #if flash11
        TilesheetStage3D.init(stage, 0, 5, init, Context3DRenderMode.AUTO);
    #else
        init();
    #end
		
    function init(?result:String):Void
    {
    //init
    addEventListener(Event.ENTER_FRAME, onEnterFrame);
    }
		
    //Add this before calling drawTiles to onEnterFrame handler
    #if flash11
    TilesheetStage3D.clearGraphic(graphics);
    #end
